# Neural Network Proof of Concept

## Overview
This project is a simplistic proof of concept for building and training a neural network from scratch using Python without any external machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn. It demonstrates fundamental neural network concepts and how they can be applied to real-world problems, such as basic mathematical operations and weather data prediction.

## What It Demonstrates
- **Neural Network Fundamentals:** Understanding of forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight adjustments.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizing input data and dynamically inferring labels.
- **Feedback Loop:** Incorporating user feedback for continuous learning and model improvement.
- **Extensibility:** The design allows for easy adaptation to other datasets, such as weather prediction.

## Neural Network Type
This is a **simple feedforward neural network** with one hidden layer, utilizing the sigmoid activation function. It is trained using supervised learning, where the network predicts outputs based on provided inputs and adjusts its parameters based on errors.

## Weather Data Training Idea
The current framework can be adapted to use weather data for predicting future weather conditions. By inputting data such as temperature, humidity, and pressure, the neural network can be trained to recognize patterns and forecast weather events like rain, snow, or temperature fluctuations. This concept demonstrates how neural networks can be applied to various domains beyond basic arithmetic, showcasing their versatility in predictive analytics.

## Running the Project
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. To train the model, run:
   ```bash
   python3 -m scripts.train
   ```

3. The model will output predictions and prompt for user feedback to refine its accuracy.
